1. Easy - here the computer will choose to move in a random position
2. Medium -here the computer will defend if it detects 2 consecutive X-es,otherwise he will choose a random move
3. Hard -apart from the features from the medium leve, the computer is capable of detecting if it has the chance to win the game if it has 2 consecutives zeroes.
